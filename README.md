# StatSlam

StatSlam is a cloud-powered web application designed for the Ateneo Golden Knights to track, store, and analyze basketball statistics with speed, accuracy, and accessibility. It modernizes the teamâ€™s workflow by replacing traditional paper-based and Excel-dependent methods with a centralized, cloud-hosted platform that ensures secure and real-time data access anytime, anywhere.

With StatSlam, coaches, players, and game officials can record detailed in-game stats such as field goals, three-pointers, free throws, rebounds, assists, turnovers, and steals. These statistics are stored in a cloud database, ensuring data integrity, automatic backup, and multi-user accessibility.
